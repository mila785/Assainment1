    <p>The combination of creativity and technology in this field deeply excites me. I believe a website is more than
        just platform for information; itâ€™s a powerful representation of a brand and its identity. To achieve my goal, I
        plan tomaster essential web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and advance to frameworks such as
        Bootstrap,Tailwind CSS, and React.js. Additionally, I aim to enhance my design skills using tools like Figma and
        Adobe XD</p>
